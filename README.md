# The Influence of Sugarcane-Derived Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) on Coral Reef Health in the Great Barrier Reef

## Background & Problem
* Coastal ecosystems face serious threats from land-derived nutrients.  
* The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is highly vulnerable to nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment.  
* Sugarcane cultivation in Queensland is a major source of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) runoff.  
* Continuous DIN discharge exerts chronic pressure on GBR water quality and coral ecosystems.

## Study Area
This study focuses on three sugarcane-dominated catchments in Queensland that drain into the Great Barrier Reef: Wet Tropics Central, Wet Tropics South, and Burdekin.

## Research Questions
1. Do agricultural practices and rainfall events significantly influence DIN outputs?  
2. Is elevated DIN associated with coral cover decline, and does this relationship exhibit lagged (delayed) effects?  
3. Does the DIN–coral relationship remain significant when considering moderators such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and salinity?

## Datasets
1. **Biogeochemical Dataset (DIN, Temperature, Salinity)**  
   [eReefs Model Data – GBR4 Daily/Monthly](https://thredds.ereefs.aims.gov.au/thredds/catalog/ereefs/GBR4_H2p0_B3p1_Cq3b_Dhnd/daily-monthly/catalog.html)
2. **Coral Cover Dataset**  
   [Great Barrier Reef Marine Monitoring Program (MMP) – Coral](https://apps.aims.gov.au/metadata/view/c30cfb2d-46be-4837-9733-9bb60489b65b)

## Planned Analysis
* This study investigates how nutrient runoff from sugarcane agriculture influences coral health across Wet Tropics and Burdekin regions of the Great Barrier Reef.  
* By combining biogeochemical model outputs and coral monitoring datasets, we will quantify the effects and time lags of DIN on coral cover.  
* The analysis aims to provide scientific evidence supporting nutrient reduction strategies to improve reef resilience and water quality in Queensland’s coastal ecosystems.
